# Code of Conduct

Modern Dev is a student-run lab and we want everyone to feel welcome.

## Our standards

Be respectful, kind, and constructive. Examples of expected behavior:

- Treat others with courtesy and patience.
- Focus feedback on code and ideas, not on people.
- Be inclusive â€” welcome contributors from diverse backgrounds.
- When disagreeing, keep discussions calm and solution-focused.

Unacceptable behavior includes harassment, hateful language, threats, doxxing, or persistent negativity.

## How to report

If you experience or witness a violation:

1. Open a private issue titled `Code of Conduct report` and describe the situation, including links and timestamps where possible.
2. Mention `@Nithwin` in the issue so maintainers are notified.

If you prefer a private contact method, include your email in the issue and a maintainer will follow up privately.

## Enforcement

Maintainers will review reports and may take actions such as asking for behavior changes, temporarily hiding comments, or removing problematic content or contributors. We will handle reports promptly and, where appropriate, confidentially.

## Agreement

By participating in this project you agree to follow this Code of Conduct.
