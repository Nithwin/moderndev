# Contributing to Modern Dev

Thanks for helping — Modern Dev is student-run and we welcome small, focused contributions.

## Quick start

1. Fork this repo and clone your fork.
2. Create a branch from `master`:
   - `feat/short-name` for features
   - `fix/short-name` for bug fixes
3. Install and run locally:

   ```powershell
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

   Make your change, keep it small, and verify it works in the browser.

## Commit & Pull Request

- Commit messages: short, present-tense (e.g. `feat: add contact form`).
- Push your branch and open a PR to `master`.

PR checklist (add this in the PR description):

- Brief summary of the change
- Link to an issue (optional)
- Screenshots or a short GIF/MP4 for UI changes (if applicable)
- Tests added or manual test steps listed

We aim to review small PRs quickly.

## Add yourself to `MEMBERS.md`

To be listed as a contributor, add a single line to `MEMBERS.md` using this format:

- [Your Name](https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo) 

Alternatively, open an issue titled `Add member: <Your Name>` with the same line and a maintainer will add you.

## Labels we use

- `good first issue` — beginner-friendly tasks
- `help wanted` — maintainers welcome assistance
- `bug` — confirmed problems
- `enhancement` — improvements or new features

## Keep it simple

- Make one focused change per PR.
- Don’t commit secrets or large binaries.
- Follow the existing code style in `components/` and `app/`.

## Code of Conduct & Security

Be respectful. If a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` exists, follow it; otherwise treat others kindly and report problems via an issue.

If you accidentally commit a secret, open an issue immediately so maintainers can help.
